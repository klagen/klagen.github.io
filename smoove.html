                Case
            </h2>
            <p>
                Create a one-pager for the new (and imaginary) Smoove concept that will be presented by Geely during 2022. Describe the vehicle and present the user with the opportunity of purchasing Smoove-merchandise
            </p>
            <h2>The process</h2>
            <p>
                The project began by creating a moodboard to make sure the whole team were on-board with the style for the upcoming work.<br><br>
                
                A greybox (a low-fidelity design with focus on functionality) was created and delivered to the web developers, meaning that the web development of the site could begin at an early stage.<br><br>

                A request was sent to the computer graphic designers, who were responsible for rendering images and animations of the vehicle. With some help from the stylesheet and they were able to provide high-quality images that were on brand.<br><br>

                A logotype was created in order to strengthen the brand and the overall impression of the website.<br><br>

                The images and final, colorized prototype of the UI was delivered to the web developers, who were then able to develop a responsive website according to the design requests they had received.
            </p>
                <h2>The solution</h2>
                <p>
                    The fully functional website is responsive and made according to the design requests made by the UI designers in the team.<br><br>
                    
                    The main colors are dark coffee and a gradient gold, to provide a sense of luxury. The logotype - a combination of the letter S and the number 8 - symbolizes sustainability, good luck and eternity. This emphasizes the sense of luxury that we aspired to deliver.<br><br>

                    At the website, the user is able to sign up for a newsletter, purchase merchandise and custom-make their own Smoove.
