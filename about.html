                        The education covers a variety of subjects such as ergonomics, user studies, usability, CAD and UX/UI.<br><br>The thesis work was performed together with Daniella Hedlund. We immersed ourselves within user studies and user experience as we investigated how design solutions can be used to stimulate interpersonal communication during conferences. The design solutions that we developed were tested on site during the conference From Business to Buttons - Sweden’s biggest user experience conference during the current year 2018. The work was performed at the request of inUse, who hosted the conference.

                        <p>
                            At ESSIQ I worked as a Design Engineer. I performed an assignment for Volvo Car Corporation, where I was a part of the thermal management team. While working as a Group Design Leader I made sure that information about the current design status was available to everyone who was involved - design engineers as well as suppliers. By creating complex documents that were still easy to orient oneself in, the communication was improved and the product development was made easier to verify.<br><br>The lively process and high pace that the product development entailed taught me the importance of thorough organization as well as quick and clear communication.

                            I was asked by Atea AB to help them in a UI assignment that was requested by one of their major customers. With short notice, I developed wireframes that were used as a blueprint by the programmers who developed an application for the customer.

                            At Espresso House I worked as a shift leader. My work assignments consisted of delivering great customer service while preventing and averting complications during the work shift.

As a result I transformed into a positive team player with the ability to organize and streamline my work assignments.
