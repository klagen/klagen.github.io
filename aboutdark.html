We immersed ourselves within user studies and user experience as we investigated how design solutions can be used to stimulate interpersonal communication during conferences. The design solutions that we developed were tested on site during the conference From Business to Buttons - Sweden’s biggest user experience conference during the current year 2018. The work was performed at the request of inUse, who hosted the conference.

                            At ESSIQ I worked as a Design Engineer. I performed an assignment for Volvo Car Corporation, where I was a part of the thermal management team. While working as a Group Design Leader I made sure that information about the current design status was available to everyone who was involved - design engineers as well as suppliers. By creating complex documents that were still easy to orient oneself in, the communication was improved and the product development was made easier to verify.<br><br>The lively process and high pace that the product development entailed taught me the importance of thorough organization as well as quick and clear communication.
