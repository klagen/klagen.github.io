            </h2>
            <p>Design an app that facilitates the booking process in the context of vaccination in Sweden.</p>
            <h2>The process</h2>
            <p>1. <b>Interviews</b> with intended users were conducted. Issues that are related to online booking today were pinpointed.<br><br>
            2. <b>Benchmarking</b> was performed. Great functions and areas of improvement were found.<br><br>
            3. A <b>greybox</b> (low-fidelity wireframe design) was created to get an overview of desired functionality and content.<br><br>
            4. <b>Testing and optimization</b> of the greybox was performed to make sure the content is intuitive and logically structured.<br><br>
            5. A colorized, high-fidelity <b>prototype</b> was created and delivered.</p>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
                Booking a time for vaccination is made difficult due to three different issues.<br><br>
                1. There are several market participants that provide different ways of booking an appointment online. There is a lack of consistency between different booking services.<br><br>
                2. At the county council's website, it is hard to book an appointment to take another vaccine than the COVID-19-vaccine. The information is not clearly presented to the website user.<br><br>
                3. When trying to book an appointment for a vaccine with high demand (such as the COVID-19 vaccine), the chosen time slot is not reserved until the booking has been performed. If another user manages to make the booking faster, the main user has to start over and the frustration increases.</p>
                <h2>Our aim</h2>
                <p>Let's create an app that lets the user book an appointment just as easily as they can book a table at a restaurant!</p>
                <h2>The solution</h2>
                <p>By gathering all market participants in one place it is possible to offer a consistent way of booking an appointment online. One single way of booking will be presented no matter which vaccine the user is looking for. In order to avoid frustration, the desired time for vaccination will be reserved for a few minutes to give the user enough time to go through with the booking.

                    The user is guided through the whole booking process. After choosing which vaccine they would like to take, they are allowed to pick an area where they would like to get vaccinated. Available time slots are shown in a calendar, before the user gets to choose a time that is suitable. The booking is confirmed before the user can choose to fill in a health declaration.<br><br>
                
                    If desired, the user can import information regarding previous vaccinations from their medical journal. Already taken vaccines will then be shown on the user's personal page, along with information about upcoming vaccinations and recommended vaccinations at the current moment.<br><br>
                    
                    In order to spread awareness and knowledge regarding the importance of vaccination, the app does also provide a rich information page with information from WHO and public health authorities. The information is presented via both written text and animated videos. A person who is afraid of needles can learn more about how they can prepare for their booked appointment to make the vaccination a more pleasant experience.</p>
