                Case
            </h2>
            <p>Design an app that facilitates the booking process in the context of vaccination in Sweden.</p>
            <h2>The process</h2>
            <p>1. <b>Interviews</b> with intended users were conducted. Issues that are related to online booking today were pinpointed.<br><br>
            2. <b>Benchmarking</b> was performed. Great functions and areas of improvement were found.<br><br>
            3. A <b>greybox</b> (low-fidelity wireframe design) was created to get an overview of desired functionality and content.<br><br>
            4. <b>Testing and optimization</b> of the greybox was performed to make sure the content is intuitive and logically structured.<br><br>
            5. A colorized, high-fidelity <b>prototype</b> was created and delivered.</p>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>
                Booking a time for vaccination is made difficult due to three different issues.<br><br>
                1. There are several market participants that provide different ways of booking an appointment online.<br><br>
                2. At the county council's website, it is hard to book an appointment to take another vaccine than the COVID-19-vaccine. The information is not clearly presented to the website user.<br><br>
                3. When trying to book an appointment for a vaccine with high demand (such as the COVID-19 vaccine), the chosen time slot is not reserved until the booking has been performed. If another user manages to make the booking faster, the main user has to start over and the frustration increases.</p>
                <h2>Our aim</h2>
                <p>Let's create an app that lets the user book an appointment just as easily as they can book a table at a restaurant!</p>
                <h2>The solution</h2>
                <p>By gathering all market participants in one place it is possible to offer a consistent way of booking an appointment online. The desired time for vaccination will be reserved for a few minutes to give the user enough time to go through with the booking.
                The app will also provide the user with the option of filling in a health declaration, or importing their previously taken vaccines from their personal medical chart.
